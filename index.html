    <h2>What is This Challenge?</h2>
    <p class="bodyText">
        Stroke remains a major global health burden, ranking as the second leading cause of death and the leading cause of long-term disability. 
        Ischemic stroke accounts for nearly 71% of all cases, with cervical artery atherosclerosis serving as a key etiological factor. 
        Owing to its real-time, low-cost, and widely accessible nature, carotid ultrasound plays a crucial role in evaluating plaque morphology 
        and identifying high-risk lesions at an early stage.
    </p>
    <p class="bodyText">
        Carotid plaques contribute to stroke through two principal mechanisms: 
        (1) progressive plaque growth leading to luminal stenosis, and 
        (2) plaque rupture resulting in thromboembolism. 
        As such, accurate assessment of plaque morphology and vulnerability is critical for stroke prevention and clinical management. 
        However, evaluation of plaque vulnerability is highly operator-dependent and particularly challenging for less experienced clinicians. 
        With the increasing demand for carotid ultrasound screening, automated methods for plaque segmentation and vulnerability classification 
        have become essential to support efficient and equitable clinical care.
    </p>
    <h2>Aims of This Challenge</h2>
    <p class="bodyText">
        The challenge aims to advance intelligent algorithms for comprehensive carotid plaque assessment. 
        Participants are expected to develop methods capable of:
    </p>
    <ul class="bodyText">
        <li>Segmenting plaque and vascular structures to automatically quantify luminal stenosis.</li>
        <li>Classifying plaque vulnerability to estimate rupture risk.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodyText">
        These automated solutions are anticipated to enhance clinical decision-making, reduce clinician workload, 
        and provide scalable diagnostic support for resource-limited regions.
    </p>

    <h2>Dataset of This Challenge</h2>
    <p class="bodyText">
        Our dataset comprises a large-scale carotid ultrasound dataset with <strong>1,500 paired cases</strong>, 
        each containing longitudinal and transverse B-mode images. The dataset was collected from a <strong>prospective study</strong> 
        involving 7 hospitals and 4 major ultrasound machine vendors, all following standardized 
        acquisition protocols to ensure high diversity and robust generalization across clinical settings. 
    </p>

    <p class="bodyText">
        Among all cases: 
    </p>
    <ul class="bodyText">
        <li><strong>1,000 pairs</strong> are provided for training</li>
        <li><strong>200 pairs</strong> for validation</li>
        <li><strong>300 hidden pairs</strong> are reserved for testing</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="bodyText">
        Each case includes two view-level segmentation masks and one instance-level classification label 
        (low-risk or high-risk). We provide <strong>all training images and annotations for 10% of cases</strong> for model development in this semi-supervised task.
        To our knowledge, this is the first and largest paired carotid plaque ultrasound dataset</strong>, 
        enabling benchmarking of both segmentation and classification methods under real-world clinical variability.
